0.04 - added in the pod documentation for Jabber::NADs and Jabber::pkt.
     - added in missing XS files NADs.xs and pkt.xs
     - rejigged the perl Makefile.PL process to cope with either the jabberd2
       checked out of cvs or the release candidates such as 
       http://files.jabberstudio.org/jabberd2/jabberd-2.0.0-a3.tar.gz

0.06 - applied patches supplied by Christopher Zorn to make the build work for j2.0s8
     - fixed an old bug with build where make was picking up Perls config.h instead
       of jabberd2s
     - for the moment - I have removed jadperl from the build, and concentrated on
       mod_perl for sm - my thinking is that there are so many Perl implementations
       for building components and clients that I should focus on the core

    * in-sess
    * out-sess

0.15 - Corrected problem with $nad->find_scoped_namespace() where an empty prefix was not 
       recognised.
		 - Fixed $nad->elem() so that it now correctly finds an element given the context of a 
		   namespace.
		 - Added $pkt->create() - this enables the creation of a new packet in the context of the 
		   current packets session.
		 Refer to the examples/MyStamp.pm for a good overview of packet handling and creation.
